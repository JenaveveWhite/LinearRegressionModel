# Overview

In this Linear Regression model, my goal was to familiarize myself with Machine Learning. This includes Sklearn, Numpy, Matplot, and Pandas

This simple model is correlating the given data to predict a countries happiness level based on the gdp per capita to answer the question, can money buy happiness?

This code was produced by following along in the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow" written by Aurelien Geron.

# Data Analysis Results

How happy is country that has a GDP of $22,587? 
based on the model the happiness would be 5.96242338 

# Development Environment

This program was created using Python in VSCode. 
Addition tools:
Sklearn
Numpy
Matplotlib
Pandas

# Future Work

* Try other values for GDP per capita
* Contribute additional comments to the code
* Input more GDP data
